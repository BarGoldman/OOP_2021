This article conducts an experiment in which simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of their solution to a smart elevator. 
The simulator records the waiting time, travel time and number of passengers in the elevator. 
The experiment uses a comparison between their access to smart elevators and approaches of older elevators to see if there really is efficiency in a smart elevator. 
The results of the experiment do show that smart elevators are more efficient in terms of waiting time than older elevators. 
This article helped us understand how to test our algorithm and how to make sure it's effective in relation to unwise elevators.

This article talks about online algorithms versus offline algorithms for the problem of elevator scheduling ,
The article presents the problem of scheduling the elevator "in the best possible way" which online algorithm is best suited ,
and to define the best interests of the offline algorithm, 
this article helps us understand the deliberate and unintentional algorithm that we are required to write in part of the task.
